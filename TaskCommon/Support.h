//
// The supporter certificate, and what it unlocks.
//
// Ported from the MajorPrivacy driver's Support.cpp, which is where the format
// is defined and where certificates for the whole family of programs are
// checked. The format is not ours to change: the same issuer signs them, the
// same fields mean the same things, and a certificate that a driver accepts has
// to be accepted here for the same reasons. So the parsing, the date
// arithmetic and the type and level tables below follow that file closely
// enough that a difference between them is a bug rather than a decision.
//
// What is different is where it runs. The original is kernel mode: pool
// allocations, RtlTimeFieldsToTime, a file read through a driver's own IO
// helper. This is a library used by a service, a module and a viewer, so it is
// QString, QDateTime and QFile, and the one thing that genuinely needs a
// platform is the signature check - see VerifySignature in the .cpp.
//
// ---- what it gates ----
//
// TaskServer and TaskRemote, and nothing else. The viewer watching its own
// machine is the whole program and needs no certificate; what needs one is the
// half that serves a machine to somebody else and the half that reaches one.
// See the comments at those two call sites for why the answer differs there -
// a service refuses to start, a module refuses to be created.
//

//
// The state, as one word plus an expiry.
//
// A bitfield rather than a struct of bools because that is what the issuer's
// scheme numbers: type and level are small integers with their own meanings and
// the flags around them are what the checks below produce. Keeping the layout
// means a certificate can be read here and its state compared with what another
// program in the family made of the same file.

//
// ---- what is deliberately not here ----
//
// No wording. Turning a status or a type into a sentence is the business of
// whoever shows it, and the two who do are a service writing one line to a
// log and a settings page with room to explain - see TaskServer/main.cpp
// and GUI/SettingsWindow.cpp. Keeping the words here would have made this
// file the place a translator had to look for text used by a program that
// has no user interface.
